		<h1>World Wide Web</h1>
	</header>
	<main>
		<p>The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system enabling documents and other
			web
			resources to be accessed over the Internet.[1]

			Documents and downloadable media are made available to the network through web servers and can be accessed
			by
			programs such as web browsers. Servers and resources on the World Wide Web are identified and located
			through
			character strings called uniform resource locators (URLs). The original and still very common document type
			is a
			web page formatted in <a target="_blank" href="HTML.html">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
			</a>. <br> This markup language supports plain text,
			images,
			embedded video and audio contents, and scripts (short programs) that implement complex user interaction. The
			HTML language also supports hyperlinks (embedded URLs) which provide immediate access to other web
			resources.
			Web navigation, or web surfing, is the common practice of following such hyperlinks across multiple
			websites.
			Web applications are web pages that function as application software. The information in the Web is
			transferred
			across the Internet using the <a href="HTML.html">Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</a>. <a href="#p-2"

		<h2>History</h2>
		<p title="History" class="text"> Web was invented by English computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee while working
			at CERN. He conceived it as an
			information management system using several concepts and technologies, the most fundamental of which was the
			connections that existed between information.[8][9][10] The first proposal was written in 1989,[7] and a
			working
			system implemented by the end of 1990 including the WorldWideWeb browser and an HTTP server.[11] The
			technology
			was released outside CERN to other research institutions starting in January 1991, and then to the general
			public on 23 August 1991. The Web was a success at CERN, and began to spread to other scientific and
			academic
			institutions. Within the next two years, there were 50 websites created.[12][13]
		</p>

		<h2>Standards</h2>
		<p>Web standards include many interdependent standards and specifications, some of which govern aspects of the
			Internet, not just the World Wide Web. Even when not web-focused, such standards directly or indirectly
			affect the development and administration of websites and web services. Considerations include the
			<mark>interoperability</mark>, <mark>accessibility</mark> and <mark>usability</mark> of web pages and web
			sites.

			Web standards, in the broader sense, consist of the following:
		<ul>
			<li>Recommendations published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)[79]</li>
			<li>"Living Standard" made by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG)</li>
			<li>Request for Comments (RFC) documents published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)[80]</li>
			<li>Standards published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)[81]</li>
			<li>Standards published by Ecma International (formerly ECMA)[82]</li>
			<li>The Unicode Standard and various Unicode Technical Reports (UTRs) published by the Unicode
				Consortium[83]</li>
			<li>Name and number registries maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)[84]</li>
		</ul>
		Web standards are not fixed sets of rules but are constantly evolving sets of finalized technical specifications
		of web technologies.[85] Web standards are developed by standards organizations—groups of interested and often
		competing parties chartered with the task of standardization—not technologies developed and declared to be a
		standard by a single individual or company. It is crucial to distinguish those specifications that are under
		development from the ones that already reached the final development status (in the case of W3C specifications,
		the highest maturity level).
		</p>
		<h2>Accessibility</h2>
		<p>There are methods for accessing the Web in alternative mediums and formats to facilitate use by individuals
			with disabilities. These disabilities may be visual, auditory, physical, speech-related, cognitive,
			neurological, or some combination. Accessibility features also help people with temporary disabilities, like
			a broken arm, or ageing users as their abilities change.[86] The Web receives information as well as
			providing information and interacting with society. The World Wide Web Consortium claims that it is
			essential that the Web be accessible, so it can provide equal access and equal opportunity to people with
			disabilities.[87] Tim Berners-Lee once noted, "The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by
			everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect."[86] Many countries regulate web accessibility as
			a requirement for websites.[88] International co-operation in the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative led to
			simple guidelines that web content authors as well as software developers can use to make the Web accessible
			to persons who may or may not be using assistive technology.[86][89]</p>
		<h2>Internationalisation</h2>
		<p>The W3C Internationalisation Activity assures that web technology works in all languages, scripts, and
			cultures.[90] Beginning in 2004 or 2005, Unicode gained ground and eventually in December 2007 surpassed
			both ASCII and Western European as the Web's most frequently used character encoding.[91] Originally RFC
			3986 allowed resources to be identified by URI in a subset of US-ASCII. RFC 3987 allows more characters—any
			character in the Universal Character Set—and now a resource can be identified by IRI in any language.[92]
