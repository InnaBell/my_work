	<h1>HTML</h1>
	<p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a
		web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages
		such as JavaScript.

		Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
		multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
		the appearance of the document.

		HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
		interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents
		by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items.
		HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as and directly introduce content
		into the page. Other tags such as surround and provide information about document text and may include other
		tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not
		display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.

		HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and
		content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium
		(W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS
		over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and
		audio, primarily using the element, in collaboration with JavaScript.</p>
	<h1>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</h1>
	<p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol in the Internet protocol suite model for
		distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.[1] HTTP is the foundation of data communication for
		the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily
		access, for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser.

		Development of HTTP was initiated by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989 and summarized in a simple document
		describing the behavior of a client and a server using the first HTTP protocol version that was named 0.9.[2]

		That first version of HTTP protocol soon evolved into a more elaborated version that was the first draft toward
		a far future version 1.0.[3]

		Development of early HTTP Requests for Comments (RFCs) started a few years later and it was a coordinated effort
		by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), with work later moving to
		the IETF.

		HTTP/1 was finalized and fully documented (as version 1.0) in 1996.[4] It evolved (as version 1.1) in 1997 and
		then its specifications were updated in 1999, 2014, and 2022.[5]

		Its secure variant named HTTPS is used by more than 80% of websites.[6]
